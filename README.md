# This respository was originally a fork of [the original](https://github.com/lancepantz/clj-yaml) and is no longer being maintained. The [project is now a part of clj-commons](https://github.com/clj-commons/clj-yaml).

`circleci/clj-yaml` provides [YAML](http://yaml.org) encoding and
decoding for Clojure via the [snakeyaml][] Java library.

## Usage

    (require '[clj-yaml.core :as yaml])

    (yaml/generate-string
      [{:name "John Smith", :age 33}
       {:name "Mary Smith", :age 27}])
    "- {name: John Smith, age: 33}\n- {name: Mary Smith, age: 27}\n"

    (yaml/parse-string "
    - {name: John Smith, age: 33}
    - name: Mary Smith
      age: 27
    ")
    => ({:name "John Smith", :age 33}
        {:name "Mary Smith", :age 27})

By default, keys are converted to clojure keywords.  To prevent this,
add `:keywords false` parameters to the `parse-string` function:

    (yaml/parse-string "
    - {name: John Smith}
    " :keywords false)
